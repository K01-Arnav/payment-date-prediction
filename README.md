## Payment Date Prediction based on past records.

B2B or Business to Business companies work on credits with other companies. When there is a trade between a buyer's business and a seller's business, the seller's business issues an invoice for the transaction. The invoice for the transaction contains various information about the goods purchased and the date by which the credit shall be cleared. Invoice Management is crucial for all businesses as it frequently trades with multiple other businesses. To correctly predict the most probable Payment Date is an important task for the accounts team to generate the invoice. The buyer must clear the credits within the established timeframe termed the credit terms or Payment Terms.

Machine learning is a sub-domain of AI that works on the principle to train a model to learn from its experience without being explicitly programmed to do so. An ML model learns in ways similar to how the human brain learns things. A model is fed with the training data to learn from experiences. The process starts with the observation of data. The model looks for patterns in the training data. 

The machine learning techniques are basically of two types: 
- Supervised Learning, 
- Unsupervised Learning.

The supervised learning technique has two types
- Classification model, 
- Regression model.

Similarly, an unsupervised machine learning model has
- Clustering Model,
- Association Model.
